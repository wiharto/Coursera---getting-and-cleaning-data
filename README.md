# Coursera---getting-and-cleaning-data

run_analysis.R tries to accomplish the following:

1. Combine the following files (from original data) into 1 big file:
   - subject_train.txt
   - X_train.txt
   - y_train.txt
   - subject_test.txt
   - X_test.txt
   - y_test.txt

2. Create a separate tidy data, which consists of the average of each 
   subject for each activity by each variable.
